# Databricks to Azure Data Factory Pipeline Migration

This project provides a framework for migrating data pipelines from Databricks to Azure Data Factory (ADF) using a structured, platform-agnostic approach. The pipeline migration process is abstracted into a unified model, and platform-specific adapters are used to translate and execute the pipeline on the target platform (Azure Data Factory).

Key Features
Unified Pipeline Model: A common data pipeline model is defined, allowing for translation between different platforms.
Databricks Adapter: Translates Databricks job configurations into the unified pipeline model.
Azure Data Factory Adapter: Converts the unified pipeline into an Azure Data Factory pipeline with corresponding activities.
Translation Logic: Migrates from Databricks-specific operations (like Spark transformations) to ADF-specific activities (like Databricks Notebook Activity or ADF Copy Activity).
Extendable Framework: Easily extend the model to support other platforms and migration paths in the future.
How It Works
Pipeline Creation: Define a pipeline with different steps such as data ingestion, transformation, and output (e.g., to a file or data warehouse).
Databricks Adapter: The pipeline steps are translated from Databricks jobs (such as reading data from a Databricks environment, filtering, and writing to a storage system) into a unified pipeline format.
Azure Data Factory Adapter: The unified pipeline is then translated into Azure Data Factory-specific activities like Copy Activity, Databricks Activity, and Sink Activity.
Execution: Once the pipeline is translated, it can be executed on Azure Data Factory.

Requirements
Python 3.x+
Azure SDK (for interacting with Azure Data Factory)
Install the required Azure libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install azure-mgmt-datafactory azure-identity
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/databricks-to-adf-migration.git
cd databricks-to-adf-migration
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up authentication with Azure (ensure you have the required permissions to interact with Azure Data Factory and Databricks):

Use Azure CLI or a service principal to authenticate.
Follow the Azure authentication guide for more details.
How to Use
1. Define Your Databricks Pipeline
Create a pipeline by defining ingestion, transformation, and output steps. Each step is represented as a PipelineStep object, where you define the step type (ingestion, transformation, output) and its configuration (such as source file path, transformation logic, and destination).

2. Translate the Pipeline to Azure Data Factory
Once you have defined the pipeline, you can translate it from Databricks to Azure Data Factory by creating an instance of the PipelineTranslator class. The translator takes care of transforming the pipeline steps into ADF-specific activities.

3. Execute the Translated Pipeline
After translating the pipeline, you can execute it on Azure Data Factory using the execute_pipeline method. This will simulate the pipeline execution.

Conclusion
This project provides a structured way to migrate Databricks jobs to Azure Data Factory pipelines. By defining a common pipeline model and using platform-specific adapters, this approach makes it easy to extend the framework for other platforms in the future.
